# 💧 Nestlé Water Distribution Management System (AI Automation Project)

This project is a modern and efficient web application for Nestlé Water Distribution, built using **Flask** and **Tailwind CSS**. It is designed to streamline inventory tracking, order processing, and communication through the integration of AI Automation components (Chatbot and Webhooks).

## ✨ Key Features

* **🌐 Flask Web Framework:** Lightweight, Python-based backend providing robust routing and logic.
* **🎨 Tailwind CSS:** Used for a fully responsive, clean, and professional user interface (UI) across all pages.
* **🤖 AI Order Assistant Integration:** Designed to integrate a dedicated Purchase Order Chatbot/Assistant (e.g., via n8n or custom webhook) to simplify order placement and inventory queries.
* **📊 Live Inventory Management:** Features a stock register designed for integration with real-time data sources (e.g., Google Sheets, SQL/NoSQL).
* **✅ Full Navigation:** Consistent and professional navigation bar linking all key modules (`Home`, `Dashboard`, `Inventory`, `Orders`, `Contact`).
